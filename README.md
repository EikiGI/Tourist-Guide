# Tourist-Guide

A simple weather and venue suggestion app using PHP.

This project was created for my job examination.
I used PHP, OpenWeatherMap API, and Foursquare Places API. 

User gets a 5 day weather forcast as well as 10 venues to visit of the city they searched for.
The Venues have details such as Shop Category, Address, Longitude and Latitude. Also you by clicking 'View Details' link
it will redirect to the venue page that is provided by the host Foursquare Places API.

*Disclaimer: All informations are being provided by the API.*
